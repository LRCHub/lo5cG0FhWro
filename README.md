[00:00.67] I never would've thought that
[00:03.17] Feelings could get thrown in the air
[00:05.01] Cause I accidentally caught that
[00:08.79] I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fought back
[00:13.96] For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
[00:19.81] That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
[00:25.13] I think about you or something like that
[00:26.91] Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
[00:30.77] I don't like that cellular convo's getting left in the wrong
[00:35.99] Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
[00:39.59] This isn't a song I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
[00:43.60] And find time to write facts (fuck)
[00:46.73] I love you
[00:51.73] 
[00:55.73] (Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
[01:07.78] Yeah, that's good)
[01:16.78] 
[01:14.26] I fucking hate you
[01:16.35] But I love you
[01:17.91] I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
[01:20.19] You're good at being perfect
[01:22.02] We're good at being troubled
[01:23.39] Yeah
[01:25.39] 
[01:26.16] I fucking hate you
[01:28.32] But I love you
[01:29.82] I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
[01:32.52] You're good at being perfect
[01:34.09] We're good at being troubled
[01:36.37] Yeah
[01:38.37] 
[01:38.85] Girl you fucking with my emotions
[01:41.84] The fuck is all this noise about?
[01:44.81] I even considered picking up smoking
[01:48.36] You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
[01:51.10] But in my dog house
[01:53.78] My bitch is the raddest
[01:54.97] Crazy who makes me the happiest
[01:56.79] Can make me the saddest
[01:57.85] Look Alice
[01:58.68] Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
[02:00.22] You're perfectly perfect for me
[02:02.45] What the fuck is this, practice?
[02:04.66] Actually, if you even consider leaving,
[02:06.72] I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing,
[02:09.75] And you'll see the meaning of stalking
[02:11.96] When I pop out the dark to find you,
[02:13.83] And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude,
[02:17.09] Then proceed to fuck up your evening
[02:19.04] Make sure you never meet again like god damn vegans,
[02:21.99] Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing.
[02:25.03] I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving,
[02:29.54] And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding,
[02:32.09] Life without you has no god damn meaning
[02:34.76] Sorry I'm passive aggressive for no god damn reason,
[02:37.94] It's that my mood change like these god damn seasons,
[02:41.74] I'll fall for you, but I love you
[02:58.24] 
[02:45.08] I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
[02:47.76] You're good at being perfect
[02:49.35] We're good at being troubled
[02:50.47] Yeah
[02:52.47] 
[02:54.72] The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it,
[02:57.72] The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it,
[03:00.42] The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it tonight.
[03:07.45] The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it,
[03:09.96] The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it,
[03:12.82] The sky is falling bitch let's try to catch it tonight.
[03:40.32] 
[03:20.12] C'mon baby
[03:23.13] Even though I hate you
[03:26.02] I still love you
[03:28.07] I love you
[03:31.53] And Salem I know
[03:35.03] I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
[03:45.14] (Come here)
[03:48.18] I like when we hold hands
[03:51.05] (You're the best around)
[03:53.80] See I get jealous (fuck)
[03:56.75] And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
[04:01.19] I just might kill him (look)
[04:03.58] (Look. I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)
[04:14.19] Love, love, love
[04:15.49] (Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
[04:18.91] (So you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)
[04:28.94] (Fuck, look)
[04:33.08] I'm in love (Love)
[04:42.08] 
[04:58.36] I fucking hate you

[05:08.88] 
[05:07.91] Wolf: Yo, so why is Samuel such a fucking dick?
[05:10.95] Salem: He isn't such a badass actually. He's only here because he ran away, because some shit happened back home. He's actually a dweeb.
[05:17.79] Wolf: Yo, what happened?
